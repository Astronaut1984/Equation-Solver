# Description:
- Simple Equation Solver of n equations with n variables.
- Works with real and complex numbers
- Simple and intuitive CLI
# Usage:
1. Enter the size of the matrix.
2. Enter whether the matrix is real or complex.
3. Enter the coefficients matrix
4. Enter the constants' matrix

## Example:
```
====================================
Enter the size of the matrix: 3
Real or Complex? (R/C): r
Enter Coefficients:
Coefficient[1][1] = 15
Coefficient[1][2] = 21
Coefficient[1][3] = 35
Coefficient[2][1] = 1
Coefficient[2][2] = 0
Coefficient[2][3] = -1
Coefficient[3][1] = 3
Coefficient[3][2] = -3
Coefficient[3][3] = -4
Enter Constants:
Constant[1] = 0
Constant[2] = 12
Constant[3] = 0

====================================
Solution:
X[1] = 1.95349
X[2] = 15.3488
X[3] = -10.0465
```
